this is my first creation in my github profile where i am practising lots and lots of things
adding second line in my first created file on github and saving the changes and then commiting it in main branch
here i create new branch and name it as kushbranch to check that if we make any changes in kush branch then that change does not reflect in main branch
east or west srivastava are best
